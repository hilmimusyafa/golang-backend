go test ./...
```

For verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

## AI-Assisted Learning Notice

This repository documents my personal learning journey in Go backend development.

AI tools are used as learning assistants to help generate explanations, draft examples, and explore different implementation approaches. However, all materials are carefully reviewed, validated, and refined as part of my study process.

My Learning Approach

- I read and analyze all AI-assisted content.
- I review and modify code to ensure deep understanding.
- I test implementations independently.
- I cross-reference with the official Go documentation.
- I adapt examples to fit real-world backend scenarios.

This repository represents an active learning process — not automated content dumping.

## Important Notes

All code examples are intended for educational purposes. Before using any code in production:

- Perform security reviews.
- Test thoroughly.
- Validate against official documentation.
- Ensure compliance with relevant licenses.

AI is used as a tool — learning and understanding remain the primary goal.
